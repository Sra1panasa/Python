What is the difference between a .py file and .ipynb file?
.py is a regular python file. It's plain text and contains just your code.
.ipynb is a python notebook and it contains the notebook code, the execution results and other internal settings in a specific format. 
Note: You can run .ipynb on the jupyter environment only that is in either jypter notebood or in google colab.
you will not be able to view .ipynb file in pycharm to view in pycharm we have to install jupter package and open in jupyter environment mode.
