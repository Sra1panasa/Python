What is the difference between a .py file and .ipynb file?
.py is a regular python file. It's plain text and contains just your code.
.ipynb is a python notebook and it contains the notebook code, the execution results and other internal settings in a specific format. 
Note: You can run .ipynb on the jupyter environment only that is in either jypter notebood or in google colab.
